# linux-utils
Here I gather shell scripts to automate dev tools installations and configurations.

## what is this all about?
I'm a tech developer where my main skills are based on Java, Javascript, and its variations and frameworks like node, typescript and stuff.

If you are familiar with that you know the environment configuration process in any OS is boring and overwhelming. I decided to relieve this process for Linux users.

I create as well a script generator that gathers all scripts that fit my needs into just one main script. Feel free to use these samples to make your own main script.

## Commands to run main scritp

```
download main script:
curl -o main-script.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edneyRoldao/linux-utils/main/main/main-script.sh

Giving exec permission to file:
chmod +x main-script.sh

Runing script:
./main-script.sh
```

## Scripts
- JDK 8 from openJDK
- JDK 11 from openJDK and JAVA_HOME environment config
- JDK 8 from Oracle
- Apache Maven and M2_HOME environment config
- Node Js
- Postman
- git
- intellij IDEA
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome
- Opera
- docker
- docker-compose
- terminator
- sublime
- mySql workbench

## Docker containers
Additionally a include a docker-compose with many services to avoid hand instalation on your OS.
- MySql server
- Postgres server
- Redis

## Notes
Those scripts were tested on the following OS:
- Linux Mint - v20.0
